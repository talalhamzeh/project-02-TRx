### Overview

TRx (pronounced Tracks) is a prescription tracking website, where you
can log current prescriptions and their histories. You may also write
journal entries to describe your experiences on your prescriptions and
any side effects you may be experiencing. Below, you can see a sample of
our medication library that describes common medications and common
adverse effects / warnings.

### Language Stack

This project was created with using React as a front-end and Firebase as the back-end.

1. JavaScript
2. HTML
3. CSS

### APIs/Packages/Technologies Used

- React
- Firebase
- OpenFDA API
- Bootstrap
- Material UI
- Axios
- SASS

### Features

A user can create an account and log in with their credientials to keep their prescriptions and journals private.

Once logged in, a user can create prescription files, keeping track of their dosages, refills, refill date, etc
They can also write journal entries to describe their experiences on certain medications and the side effects and pain levels they are experiencing.

The website features a medication library, where you can create new medication information in the database by searching a medication and having an API retrieve information on it, such as the brand and generic name, description, and adverse effects.

### Improvements

There are still quite a few bugs that can be fixed throughout the site and I think due to each page being a single page application it is essential we implement more automatic page updating without the user having to refresh to see any changes.

### Acknowledgments

Thank you to the colloboration of all the groupmates and of course, Joel and Loden for always providing the BEST guidance.
